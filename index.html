  <h3 id = "facts-header">Here are some facts about him:</h3>
      <li>C.V.Raman was born in 7 November 1888.</li>
      <li>C.V.Raman was a scientist in Physics, who won nobel prize in 1930.</li>
      <li>Raman passed his matriculation examination at the age of 11.</li>
      <li>Raman resigned from his government service after he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta.</li>
      <li>He continued doing research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Calcutta, where he became the Honorary Secretary.</li>
     <li> On 28 February 1928, Raman led an experiment with K. S. Krishnan, on the scattering of light, when he discovered what now is called the Raman effect.</li>
      <li>Raman and Suri Bhagavantam discovered the quantum photon spin in 1932, which further confirmed the quantum nature of light.</li>
      <li>At the end of October 1970, Raman collapsed in his laboratory; the valves of his heart had given way. He was moved to the hospital and the doctors gave him four days to live. He survived and after a few days he refused to stay in the hospital as he preferred to die in the gardens of his Institute surrounded by his followers.</li>
      <li>C.V.Raman died on 21 November 1970.</li>
